# Group Clarification
(My bad :())
I know this was supposed to be a group challenge but I couldn't join until late afternoon. I didn't see the femhack-team email until way later and I didn't know we had a 
team assiged (I thought we had to find people on our own and I guessed everyone probably had a team by the time I joind, my bad for not asking ). My team had a lot of work done and I didn't want to take credit for almost not helping so I did this by myself. I understand if it doesn't count the same, I had a lot of fun doing it though :D 
My original team was team 10
